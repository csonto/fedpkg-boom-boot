The spec file is a clean up of original spec file - I removed all the conditionals, as there is an open issue whether /usr/bin/boom should use python2, python3 or what.

## NOTES

### Projet name and package name

The original project is called *boom*. However package with that name had already existed in previous releases of Fedora.
